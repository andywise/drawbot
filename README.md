## Wiring

## Hardware Assembly

Thank you to the kind people at the Johnson County Library's Black & Veatch [MakerSpace](https://www.jocolibrary.org/makerspace) for documenting the assembly process at [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/id/Drawbot/).

## Raspberry Pi Zero W Basic Setup

1. **Download and install [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)**.
2. **Download and install latest [Raspbian OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)** and flash it onto your SD card with Etcher.
3. **Enable SSH** by adding a blank file named `ssh` (no extension) to the `boot` directory on the Pi's SD card. (Last tested with Raspbian Stretch Lite 2018-06-27 version.)
4. **Set up Wifi** by adding a file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the same `boot` directory with the following contents (replace `MySSID` and `MyPassword` with your credentials):

   ```
   ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
   update_config=1

   network={
   	ssid="MySSID"
   	psk="MyPassword"
   }
   ```

   - Note that if you're using the latest version of raspbian (Buster as of this writing) you can use `raspi-config` to set the wifi. [See the notes here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md).

## Software Prerequisites

From a device connected to the same network as the Drawbot Pi, SSH into the Pi with `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`. The default password is `raspberry`.

Then, on the Drawbot Pi:

1. **Update, upgrade, and install NPM, Git.** (Automatically answer "yes" to everything.):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo apt-get install git
```

2. **Install Node.js.**

```bash
sudo npm install -g n # Install **n** for node.js version management. [github.com/tj/n](https://github.com/tj/n)
sudo n stable # Install latest stable version of Node.js. Last tested with v10.8.0
```

3. **Upgrade NPM.** (and remove old apt-get version).

```bash
sudo npm install npm@latest -g
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo reboot # (After rebooting, you'll have to SSH into the Pi again.)
```

4. **Install pigpio C library.** [npmjs.com/package/pigpio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pigpio)

This C library controls the commuincation to the GPIO pins. The node library that you will install later of the same name is an interface that accesses this library. If your code has problems accessing the GPIO pins you may need to re-install this library.

```bash
 # Only needed if you're using Raspbian *Lite*
sudo apt-get install pigpio

# For this project you don't need to run this npm install because pigpio is
# already a dependency in package.json, but if you use pigpio in another
# project be sure to install the npm version of the package AFTER installing the c library.
npm install pigpio
```

## Installation

On the Drawbot Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andywise/drawbot.git # to clone this repository.
cd drawbot
npm i
```

## Use

On the Drawbot Pi:

- Run `npm start` or `sudo node draw.js` to start the Drawbot controller.

It's important to know that in order to use the pigpio C library you have to run your node script in super user mode, so the `sudo` is required.

If you want to run the process from [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) so that it can run as a background process you'll need to use sudo as well:

```bash
# start the process
pm2 start npm --name "drawbot" -- start


# save the process so that it will exist after a restart
sudo pm2 save
```

After starting as the super user, remember that all of your other commands will also need `sudo` (e.g. `sudo pm2 list`, `sudo pm2 log --name drawbot`, etc).

## Controlling the Drawbot

On a device connected to the same local network as the Drawbot Pi:

- Go to [raspberrypi.local/control](http://raspberrypi.local/control) to access the Drawbot control interface.
- Use the "bullseye" interface to manually position the gondola, or raise/lower the pen/marker.
- Use the settings panel to configure the Drawbot's `D`, `X`, and `Y` values (see "Configuration" below).
- Drag and drop an SVG file onto the control interface to send artwork to the Drawbot!

### SVG Artwork Notes:

- **Only the first `<path>` element will be drawn**, so if necessary, combine artwork into a single compound path.
- The Drawbot will scale artwork so that **1 pixel = 1 millimeter**.

## Configuration

- **Enter value for `D`:** measure distance between string starting points (in millimeters).
- **Enter starting `X` and `Y` values:** measure distance from left and top (respectively) of left string starting point to initial pen position (also in mm).
- Note: Values will be stored in the `config.json` file.
